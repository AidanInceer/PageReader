  "extracted_text": "Abstract. Neural text-to-speech systems have made significant advances in recent years, achieving near-human quality in synthetic speech generation. This paper reviews the latest developments in neural TTS architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Introduction. Text-to-speech synthesis has evolved from concatenative and parametric approaches to modern neural network-based systems. The introduction of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the field, enabling end-to-end learning of acoustic models that can generate highly natural-sounding speech. Background. Traditional TTS systems relied on concatenating pre-recorded speech units or using parametric models to generate waveforms. These approaches suffered from limitations in naturalness and expressiveness. Neural TTS Systems. Modern neural TTS systems use deep learning architectures such as WaveNet, Tacotron, and FastSpeech to learn direct mappings from text to speech. These models can capture complex acoustic patterns and generate highly realistic speech with proper prosody and intonation. Evaluation. We evaluate various neural TTS systems using both objective metrics (MOS scores, word error rates) and subjective human listening tests. Results show that state-of-the-art systems achieve quality comparable to human speech in many scenarios.",
